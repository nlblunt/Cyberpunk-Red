## Bio
**Dr. Vivian Kaine** is the Face and driving force behind [Aether Materials Dynamics]({% link _corporations/Aether Materials Dynamics.md %}). She embodies the "Exec" Role, using her intellectual acumen and ruthless management style to secure AMD’s foothold in the Night City market.

- **Corporate History:** V Kaine spent years moving up the tiers of a prior, smaller corporate entity, developing expertise in materials science and logistical control. She learned that in the corporate world, there are people beneath you who would kill for your job, and those above you who would kill to keep you out of theirs—literally. She launched AMD to avoid the terminal stagnation faced by many designers working within established worlds.
- **The Exec Role:** As an Exec, her primary **Role Ability is Teamwork**. She uses this to surround herself with skilled employees, including team members who may have overt jobs (like secretary or driver) and covert roles (such as a Netrunner, bodyguard, or assassin). Last week, V likely tasked her team with a headhunting run to "extract" a rival researcher or sabotage a competitor's database.
- **Housing and Perks:** As an executive, Dr. Kaine enjoys significant employment benefits, including **free Corporate housing** (a Corporate Conapt) as long as she remains with AMD. This conapt likely places her in a secure, upscale area of the city, such as the **Executive Zone** or a Corporate Terrace like the Ziggurat's "The Hanging Garden" (C9) in the Upper Marina. Her living situation is a **Good Prepak Lifestyle**, paid for by the corporation.
- **The Corporate "Face":** Dr. Kaine is the mandated "Face" for AMD. This means she is the single largest stockholder and is personally responsible for any crimes or illegal activities committed by the corporation. This arrangement forces her to ensure that whatever trouble AMD gets into "isn't connected directly to the management of the Corporation".
- **Aspiration:** V Kaine’s ultimate goal is to cement AMD as a permanent major player, eventually expanding beyond Night City, and becoming one of the new Megacorps that rise from the post-War environment. She operates with the ethos that "If you want to make it in the Neocorporate world you have to remember the number one rule: **STAY HUNGRY**".
