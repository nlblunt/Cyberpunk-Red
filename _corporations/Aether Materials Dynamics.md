# Aether Materials Dynamics
**Aether Materials Dynamics (AMD)** is a newly established Neocorp focused on rapid urban development solutions. They are moving into Night City to take advantage of the massive rebuilding effort following the [Night City Holocaust of 2023]({% link _lore/Night City Holocaust of 2023.md %}).

## Corporate Profile
- **Industry Focus:** Specialized modular construction materials and rapid-deployment infrastructure. 
- **Primary Goal:** To provide high-quality, dense, and cost-effective prefabricated construction modules, specifically targeting the need for quick housing and fortified commercial spaces in the Rebuilding Urban Center and Overpacked Suburbs.
- **Competition:** AMD’s main competition includes established construction companies and material suppliers already active in the city, such as **Zhirafa** (known for its GRAF3 construction drones)  and even major arms manufacturers like **Militech**, which has been researching new forms of blast-proof material. AMD also runs the risk of being acquired or sabotaged by larger Megacorps, a deadly game known as Corporate headhunting.
- **Night City Base of Operations:** AMD has recently secured commercial space, likely a Corporate Conapt or office park near the **Heywood Industrial Zone** (like the Zhirafa Office Park MicroVillage, C10). They are striving to build up their reputation alongside existing local Corps.
- **Corporate Philosophy:** AMD operates with aggressive efficiency, believing that profit and order are achieved by moving faster than the competition. Like all ambitious firms in the savage world of Big Business, they recognize that assassination and kidnapping are expected, especially when pursuing key personnel from rival firms.
