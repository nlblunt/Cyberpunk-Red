# Neuro-Chem Labs (NCL) Profile
**Neuro-Chem Labs (NCL)** specializes in advanced pharmaceutical synthesis and research, operating as a Local Corp that often relies on Edgerunner resources to survive the competitive Night City market.

## Corporate Profile
- **Industry Focus**: Advanced Pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis.
- **Primary Goal**: Synthesizing and distributing specialized, high-demand pharmaceuticals (like **Speedheal, Stim, Rapidetox, and Antibiotic**) and custom chemical additives (Delaying Compound, Distilling Compound, Osmosis Compound). NCL avoids the bulk Kibble/food market dominated by corporations like Continental Brands.
- **Competition**: **Biotechnica** (dominant force in biotech/pharmaceuticals, controls therapy materials); other ripperdocs/clinics; and Fixers like **Hornet** who already control large portions of the drug and biotech market. The company runs the risk of industrial sabotage, theft, or being targeted for hostile takeover ("Corporate headhunting").
- **Night City Base of Operations:** **Upper Marina** (Near Night City University/Biotechnica Campus or City Medical Center)
- **Key Expertise/Staff:** The company is likely staffed by Medtechs who utilize the Medical Tech (Pharmaceuticals) specialty to synthesize doses. A Medtech can make a number of doses equal to their Medical Tech Skill from 200eb of materials in 1 hour. They would use devices like the **Chemical Analyzer** to test substances.
- **Corporate Philosophy:**

## Synergy and Market Niche

Neuro-Chem Labs fits into the Night City ecosystem by filling a demand for high-quality, synthesized medical supplies and performance-enhancing/incapacitating agents that cannot be synthesized easily by average street vendors.

1. **High-Demand Products:** NCL focuses on pharmaceuticals like **Speedheal** (heals HP based on BODY + WILL) and **Stim** (ignores Seriously Wounded penalties for an hour). They can also synthesize drugs like **Sedative** or **Veritas** (truth serum) for hostile acquisition or espionage missions.
2. **Corporate/Black Market Tie-Ins:** They can supply custom chemical components, such as compounds that delay poison effects or turn them into contact-based hazards, possibly assisting groups like the **Tyger Claws** (who are known to seek power) or other criminal organizations who need chemicals.
3. **Vulnerability:** As a Local Corp, NCL is highly susceptible to the actions of Megacorps like Biotechnica, which established its reputation by pioneering advanced pharmaceuticals during the 4th Corporate War.
