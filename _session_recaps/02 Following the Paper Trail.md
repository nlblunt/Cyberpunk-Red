# Session Summary
The players, seeking refuge, discovered an abandoned and locked cargo container within territory controlled by the Tyger Claws. Inside, they found an identification badge belonging to Sam, an employee of a company called Neuro-Chem Labs. A quick search revealed Neuro-Chem Labs to be a recently established, small firm located nearby.

The party decided to return the badge and traveled to Neuro-Chem Labs. They requested to speak with the manager, Max, but he reacted negatively to their arrival and claimed Sam had called in sick and then quit several days prior. Petra, however, detected deception in Max’s statement. 

A brief conversation with the receptionist proved fruitful. She provided Petra with Sam’s employee file, along with a separate, anonymous note indicating the receptionist also believed Max was lying. 

Following this lead, the party investigated Sam’s cargo container residence and found a disturbing scene: a puddle of blood and overturned furniture. They concluded Sam had likely been either killed or abducted. A crumpled piece of paper discovered at the scene contained an address and a date from a few days earlier.

The address led them to an abandoned warehouse at a derelict dock. Inside, they uncovered evidence of a Piranha gang gathering, as well as signs that a shipment had recently arrived via the river. 

To learn more about the potential shipment, Petra contacted her Netrunner connection, Booma, requesting information about any covert deliveries in the area. Booma agreed to investigate.
