# Session Summary
The player characters began their session with a casual gathering at Joe's Diner. However, their meal was cut short by the arrival of a group of Piranha gang members who aggressively demanded money from everyone present. This led to a violent confrontation, in which the player characters were victorious. During the fight, both the Piranha lieutenant and one of his subordinates were killed. 

After the battle, the party searched the bodies. They found a curious object identified as "Piranha Smash" on the lieutenant, and also discovered an employee identification card that indicated he was not officially affiliated with the Piranha gang. As the sounds of approaching law enforcement filled the air, the player characters chose to leave the diner unnoticed through a back exit, avoiding potential complications.
